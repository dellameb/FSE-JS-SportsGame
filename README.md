Using what we know about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Let's build a simple sports game. 

The game will have 2 teams. 

Each team can shoot causing the shot counter to increase. There is a random chance you may score when you shoot. 

If you score, the score should increase for the team.

If the reset button is clicked, each team's shot count and score should be reset to 0 and the reset counter should increase by 1. 

There are some bonus features you can add as well like playing a sound when shooting and scoring.
